      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently work in finance and am looking to change directions in my career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love playing music, video and board games, and listening to podcasts while going on walks.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If money was no obstacle, I'd love to run a recording studio. More realistically, something related to video game development in a non-exploitative environment.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sandy Springs, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've worked in finance for about seven years, and it isn't for me. I've always been curious to learn coding and decided to take the plunge on the advice of some friends to try a new direction!</p>
